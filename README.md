# BamazonManager

Overview

This application creates an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL gathered so far. The app takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

The screen shot shows the output since it is a CLI application the solution presented here is based on the intermediate level.

In here, a node application called bamazonManager.js is created which runs the application.
The schema contains properties as Product_name, Department_name, Price, and Stock_quantity
When the program is implemented, a set of menu options is displayed.

The user can: 
1. View Products for Sale
2. View Low Inventory
3. Add to Inventory
4. Add New Product


When option "View Products for Sale" is selected, a list of every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities are displayed.

Next, if "View Low Inventory" is selected, then it should list all items with an inventory count lower than five.

If "Add to Inventory" is selected, you will see a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.

And lastly, if "Add New Product" is selected, the user should be able to add a completely new product to the store.

Below is a link to the sample output of the solution in screen shots.
